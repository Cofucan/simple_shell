# Simple Shell

## Issues To Fix
- Handle the EOF condition in the program entry point file (task 1).
- Handle the EOF condition in the custom getline function (task 6).
- Handle the "permission denied" issue when you.
- Line 33 of `ss-getline.c`, find out if that error needs to be printed.
- Test out the setenv feature for new variables.

!IMPORTANT
- Remember to free the new environ you allocated when updating the env variables.
- Try to see if you can free environ before the program ends.
- Try to see if you can use VS Code to see what has been freed or not.
